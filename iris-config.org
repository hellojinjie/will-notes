So I now have a Retina MacBook Pro, named iris after Iris Murdoch.  All my laptops have been named after 20th/21st century philosophers: 

| name    | philosopher         | machine             |
|---------+---------------------+---------------------|
| gottlob | Gottlob Frege       | IBM Thinkpad        |
| ludwig  | Ludwig Wittgenstein | PowerBook G4        |
| bert    | Bertrand Russell    | MacBook Pro         |
| willard | W. V. O. Quine      | iMac                |
| slavoj  | Slavoj Žižek        | MacBook Pro unibody |
| iris    | Iros Murdoch        | Retina MacBook Pro  |
|         |                     |                     |

* Software to install on a new Mac

** Inital stages - App store, Dropbox, 1Password
+ Apps from the App Store are easy
  + Just log on with your Apple ID and get them from the App Store app. 
** Python 
+ Install Enthought's Canopy distribution
  + https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/
  + Get 64-bit version
  + Free Academic License (requires registration using an academic email address) 
+ Run Canopy.app to set up as default python installation
  + This adds a line to =~/.profile= that sources their activation script
  + By default it esses with your prompt.  To fix this, add the following line to =~/.profile=
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
# Stop Canopy from messing with $PS1
export VIRTUAL_ENV_DISABLE_PROMPT=y
    #+END_SRC
+ Use package manager ro install all Canopy packages
+ Other packages need to be installed by hand
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    easy_install pip
    pip install astropy
    pip install elpy
    pip install rope
    pip install jedi
    pip install pyregion
  #+END_SRC
+ Some need to be built from source
  + [X] scikit-image was problematic
    + Canopy had version 0.5 for some reason, which is wat to old (didn't have =morpholoy.dilate=, which I use a lot. 
    + The latest version on pypi was 0.8, but this seems to have a bug
    + So grab latest dev version (0.9dev at time of writing)
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
        cd ~/Source
        git clone http://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image.git
      #+END_SRC
      And build and install it
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
        cd ~/Source/scikit-image
        python setup.py build
        python setup.py install
      #+END_SRC
** Fonts
*** Courier Prime
+ http://quoteunquoteapps.com/courierprime/
+ This font was designed for writing movie scripts, but it is a great general-purpose monospace font.
+ It comes with regular, /italic/, *bold*, and /*bold italic*/ versions. 
+ It is much more robust looking than the standard Courier, which always looked too spindly to me.
+ On a retina display, it is perfectly legible as small as 9 pt, although you probably want it bigger than that.
** Utilities
*** Moom - Window Control
*** Mailplane
*** 1Password

** Consumer software

** System software

*** rsync
+ OS X already has rsync, but it is version 2.6.9 from 2008!
  + In particular, it doesn't copy extended attributes properly
  + This is important since I don't want to lose any metadata when I copy over files from my old laptop.
+ So I install the latest version via homebrew:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
brew tap homebrew/dupes
brew info libiconv
brew install homebrew/dupes/libiconv
brew install homebrew/dupes/rsync
  #+END_SRC
+ Note that to use it, it is necessary to give the full path, since =/usr/bin= is before =/usr/local/bin= in y =$PATH=
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh :results verbatim 
rsync --version
  #+END_SRC

  #+RESULTS:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

** Science

*** Bibdesk
+ Installed without any trouble
+ [-] But having problems with the relative paths to attached PDFs
  + [X] First problem was with symbilic link on slavoj pointing back from Dropbox to local folder
    + [X] Fixed that by having Dropbox contain the real folder with symbolic link /from/ local folder
  + [-] Second problem is with files that have a literal "\" somewhere in the path
    + These are quite common in the autogenerated names of the PDF files. The chief culprits are:
      1. "\i" in author name - other accented characters get converted to UTF-8 fine
      2. Things like "\﻿mu" in the paper title (by the way, there is a "zero width no-break space" after the \ to fool org-mode into not rendering it as \mu).
    + It seems that Dropbox simply ignores these files, they are not synched at all.
    + [-] So we will have to fix the filenames so they don't contain the "\".
      + [X] This is now fixed on iris
        + I have switched over to a more sensible file naming scheme, =Author/CiteKey-N.pdf=, which also removes all special characters.
        + Example: =Henney/Henney2013a-0.pdf=
      + [ ] Hopefuly, this can be done by tweaking Bibdesk settings on slavoj - not sure how easily.
        + [ ] Quit BibDesk on iris
        + [ ] Copy over the configuration from iris to slavoj
          + =/Users/will/Library/Preferences/edu.ucsd.cs.mmccrack.bibdesk.plist=
        + [ ] Consolidate all the files on slavoj
          + =Shift-Cmd-K= I think
          + This should replace all the problematic paths with nice clean ones that DropBox can sync.
        + [ ] Do I want to regenerate cite keys first?


        


*** SAOImage ds9
+ Installed the latest binary distribution
+ But only runs when started from the installation directory


* [1/3] Transferring my files from slavoj
+ [X] I decided not just to copy over everything blindly with the migration assistant.
  + I did actually try to use Migration Assistant to copy over my just my home directory, but it was going to take 4 hours (even over thunderbolt) and there is no way of suspending it halfway through and resuming.
  + [X] I need to find out where it was writing its files and delete them, since I am pretty sure that it didn't clean up
    + [X] Run DaisyDisk to find big folders
    + [X] Turns out that it did clean up after all
      + The only large system folder (18GB) contains the sleep image
+ [ ] Instead I am using rsync to copy my home directory
  + I tried it over the network, but that didn't work
  + But it works fine with the old laptop connected via thunderbolt in "Target Disk Mode".
  + Command options used:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    rsync -avPX 
    #+END_SRC
  + [2/9] Folders I am copying over (in order of last access date)
    + [X] ~/Admin/ very small
    + [X] ~/Work/ pretty big (176 GB)
      + All copied [2013-05-03 Fri 11:35]
    + [ ] ~/Documents
      + [ ] Do I really want all of this?
      + Certainly want Web Receipts
    + [ ] ~/Source
    + [ ] ~/bin
      + Mostly junk, but some useful things
    + [ ] ~/Teaching
    + [ ] ~/RMAA
    + [ ] *Hidden folders*
      + [ ] Need to check these in dired or terminal since they don't show up in Finder
    + [ ] 
+ [ ] How to deal with iTunes Library?
  + [ ] Probably best to temporarily set the Library file in iTunes to be the old laptop's iTunes Library, and then do "Consolidate Library"

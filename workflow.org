Useful snippets on how to do stuff

* Stashing/rebasing with git                                      :emacs:git:
This is a very common occurence for me. 
+ You may have some local commits, plus some uncommited changes and untracked files
+ You want to pull in someone else's changes and carry on working
** Magit version
+ Stash all your uncommited work: =z -u z=, then type name of stash
+ Fetch other people's new commits: =f f=
+ [Optional] Rebase your un-pushed commits, if any: =R=
+ Pop your stash: =A= with point on the line showing the stash in question
** Raw git version
+ =git stash save -u=
+ =git fetch=
+ =git rebase refs/remotes/origin/master=
+ =git stash pop=

* Including movies in PDF files from LaTeX                            :latex:

* Viewing "Tab-separated value" data files in emacs            :emacs:cloudy:
+ =M-x tsv-mode= turns on a [[https://github.com/emacsmirror/tsv-mode/blob/master/tsv-mode.el][nice mode]] by Ye Wenbin, which is very useful for perusing Cloudy output and other tab-delimited files
+ I have the following in my set-up, which means that the column names always appear at the top in a bar, even when you scroll down the file
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(add-hook 'tsv-mode-hook
	  (lambda ()
	    ;; Use the first line to define the column names
	    (tsv-first-line-as-header)
	    ))
#+END_SRC
+ Without that, it just says "col1", "col2", etc
** Useful keybindings
+ =TAB=/=S-TAB=: next/previous field
+ =H=/=S=: hide/show column (not sure how to reveal all)
+ =<=/=>=: narrow/widen column
+ =C-c C-n=/=C-c C-w=: set width of this/all columns
+ =s=/=w=/=RET=: show/copy/edit field at point
** Things that need fixing
+ Main problem is with the header columns. These do adapt to resizing the columns, but there are other circumstances, where they will get misaligned:
  + If the full table width does not fit on the screen, then the header columns do not move when you scroll horizontally
  + If you resize the text font (e.g., with trackpad gestures =magnify-up=, =magnify-down=), then the header font does not change, and so the columns do not align

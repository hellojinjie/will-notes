Useful snippets on how to do stuff

* Stashing/rebasing with git                                      :emacs:git:
This is a very common occurence for me. 
+ You may have some local commits, plus some uncommited changes and untracked files
+ You want to pull in someone else's changes and carry on working
** Magit version
+ Stash all your uncommited work: =z -u z=, then type name of stash
+ Fetch other people's new commits: =f f=
+ [Optional] Rebase your un-pushed commits, if any: =R=
+ Pop your stash: =A= with point on the line showing the stash in question
** Raw git version
+ =git stash save -u=
+ =git fetch=
+ =git rebase refs/remotes/origin/master=
+ =git stash pop=

So I now have a Retina MacBook Pro, named iris after Iris Murdoch.  All my laptops have been named after 20th/21st century philosophers: 

| name    | philosopher         | machine             |
|---------+---------------------+---------------------|
| gottlob | Gottlob Frege       | IBM Thinkpad        |
| ludwig  | Ludwig Wittgenstein | PowerBook G4        |
| bert    | Bertrand Russell    | MacBook Pro         |
| willard | W. V. O. Quine      | iMac                |
| slavoj  | Slavoj Žižek        | MacBook Pro unibody |
| iris    | Iros Murdoch        | Retina MacBook Pro  |
|         |                     |                     |

** Fonts
*** Courier Prime
+ http://quoteunquoteapps.com/courierprime/
+ This font was designed for writing movie scripts, but it is a great general-purpose monospace font.
+ It comes with regular, /italic/, *bold*, and /*bold italic*/ versions. 
+ It is much more robust looking than the standard Courier, which always looked too spindly to me.
+ On a retina display, it is perfectly legible as small as 9 pt, although you probably want it bigger than that.
** Utilities
*** Moom - Window Control
*** Mailplane
*** 1Password

** Consumer software
